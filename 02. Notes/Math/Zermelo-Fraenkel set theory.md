**ZF** is an axiomatic system that was proposed in the early twentieth century in order to formulate a theory of sets free of paradoxes such as [[Russell's paradox]].^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory]

>[!Warning]- ZF and ZFC
>Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice included is abbreviated **ZFC**, where C stands for "choice", and **ZF** refers to the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice excluded.

>[!Hint] Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers
[[Natural Numbers]] could be defined by set theory, which was first published by John von Neumann. ^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-theoretic_definition_of_natural_numbers]
