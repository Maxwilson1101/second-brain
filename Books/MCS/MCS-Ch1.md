# What is a Proof?
## The Axiomatic Method

The standard procedure for establishing truth in mathematics was invented by [[The Elements|Euclid]], a mathematician working in Alexandria, Egypt around 300 BC. His idea was to begin with five *assumptions* about geometry, which seemed undeniable based on direct experience. Propositions like these that are simply accepted as true are called *axioms*.

A *proof* is a sequence of logical deductions from axioms and previously proved statements that concludes with the proposition in question.

Euclid's axiom-and-proof approach, now called the *axiomatic method*, remains the foundation for mathematics today. In fact, just a handful of axioms, called the Zermelo-Fraenkel with Choice axioms ([[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]]), together with a few logical deduction rules, appear to be sufficient to derive essentially all of mathematics.

## Our Axioms

The ZFC axioms are important in studying and justifying the foundations of mathematics, but for practical purposes, they are much too primitive. Proving theorems in ZFC is a little like writing programs in byte code instead of a full-fledged programming language—by one reckoning, a formal proof in ZFC that $2+2=4$ requires more than 20,000 steps! So instead of starting with ZFC, we’re going to take a *huge* set of axioms as our foundation: we’ll accept all familiar facts from high school math.
